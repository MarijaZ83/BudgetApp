- An application that serves the user to calculate private income and expenses
- It should contain a header text: "Available Budget in..." and then the current month and year
- The current budget should be written below the text. If the user has more income, the first character should be a plus sign "+", if expenses are greater than income, it should be a minus sign "-"
- Below that are fields income and expenses. Expenses should also show the percentage of income that has been used. Expenses can be higher than income, so the percentage itself can be over 100, if there is no income, an exception should be processed
- In the form is a field for entering a description where the user can enter arbitrary text. This field must not be empty or contain text longer than 50 characters
- The field for entering the amount must receive only number values, it must not be empty or less than 1.
- Submit button that changes color depending on whether the input is expenses or income
- The column with expenses will also have the percentage of expenses that refers to how much of the total revenue budget has been used (again, it should be taken into account that the expenses may be greater than the total income and situations when we have no income entered)
